# Total Earnings Calculator Scripts

This repository contains two Groovy scripts that help users calculate their total earnings based on their job history and additional incomes.

## 1. TotalEarningsCalculator1.groovy
This script calculates the total amount of money a user has earned through their life based on the number of jobs they have had, the monthly salary, and the number of months worked at each job. Additionally, users can include other income amounts at the end of the process.

### Usage:
1. Run the script in a Groovy environment.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the number of jobs you have had.
3. For each job, enter the number of months worked and the monthly salary.
4. After entering job details, the script will ask if you have any other income amounts to add. Enter 'yes' to add more income or 'no' to finish.
5. The script will display the total amount of money you have earned, represented in Romanian Leu (RON).

### Script Logic:
- The script iteratively asks for user input regarding the details of each job and calculates the earnings based on the monthly salary and months worked.
- After processing all jobs, the script allows the user to add additional income amounts.
- The total earnings are then displayed in RON.

## 2. TotalEarningsCalculator2.groovy
This script is essentially identical to `TotalEarningsCalculator1.groovy` and follows the same logic and usage instructions.

### Usage:
Follow the same usage instructions as for `TotalEarningsCalculator1.groovy`.

### Script Logic:
- Similar to the first script, it calculates total earnings based on job details and additional income.
- The total earnings are displayed in RON.

## Prerequisites:
- Groovy installed on your system.

## Running the Scripts:
1. Save the scripts to your local machine with the `.groovy` extension.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script by executing `groovy <script_name>.groovy` in the terminal/command prompt.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the necessary details.

## Notes:
- Ensure to enter valid numeric inputs when prompted; otherwise, the script will terminate with an error message.
- The total earnings are represented in Romanian Leu (RON).

Hope you find these scripts useful for calculating your total earnings over the years!
